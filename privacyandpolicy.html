                <p>Information provided by users allows us to improve our sites and provide you with the most
                    user-friendly experience. All information required depends on the service, and we may use the above
                    user information to maintain, protect and improve its services (including advertising services) and
                    to develop new services. Such information is not considered sensitive if it is freely available and
                    in the public domain or is provided under the Information Act 2005 or any other law for the time
                    being in force.</p>
                <h4>COOKIES</h4>
                <P>To improve the responsiveness of the Sites to our users, we may use cookies or similar electronic
                    tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a user identifier
                    (user ID) to understand the user's individual interests using the Identified Computer. If you do not
                    voluntarily identify yourself (for example, through registration), we will not know who you are,
                    even if we set a cookie on your computer. The only personal information a cookie may contain is
                    information you provide (an example of this is when you request our personalized horoscope). The
                    cookie cannot read data from your hard drive. Our advertisers may also set their own cookies on your
                    browser (when you click on their ads), a process we do not control. Our web servers automatically
                    collect limited information about your computer's Internet connection, including your IP address,
                    when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that tells computers connected to the Internet
                    where to send data to you — such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you
                    personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor the site
                    to our users' interests, to measure traffic to our site, and to inform advertisers of the geographic
                    locations from which our visitors come.</P>
                <H4>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</H4>
                <P>Our policy only discloses the privacy policy of our website. Our site also provides links to other
                    websites that are not under our control. We are not responsible for the use of such sites.</P>
                <H4>SHARING INFORMATION</H4>
                <P>We will share sensitive personal data with any third party without the prior consent of the user in
                    the following limited cases:</P>
                <ul>
                    <li>If disclosure is required or required by law or any court or governmental agency or agency to
                        verify identity or to prevent, detect, investigate or prosecute or punish cyber incidents. These
                        disclosures are made in good faith and in the belief that such disclosure is reasonably
                        necessary to enforce these Terms; for compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
                    <li>We propose to share such information with our group companies and officers and employees of such
                        group companies to process personal data on its behalf. We also ensure that those recipients of
                        such information agree to process such information in accordance with our instructions and this
                        Privacy Policy and other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>INFORMATION SECURITY</h4>
                <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized
                    modification, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data
                    collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption
                    and physical security measures to protect against unauthorized access to the systems where we store
                    personal data. All information collected on our website is securely stored in our controlled
                    database. The database is stored behind a firewall on secure servers; access to the servers is
                    password protected and strictly limited. But as effective as our security measures are, no security
                    system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database or that any information you
                    transmit to us over the Internet will not be intercepted. And of course, any information you post in
                    the discussion areas is available to anyone with internet access. However, the Internet is a
                    constantly evolving medium. We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time to incorporate any
                    necessary future changes. Of course, our use of the information we collect will always be consistent
                    with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be.
